### Download the Latest Release

- [https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/mycrypto.com/releases](https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/mycrypto.com/releases)


### Developers

- If you would like to contribute, please look at [our new and improved React/Typescript Repo](https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/MyCrypto)

- master is the working / development branch

- gh-pages contains only the smaller dist folder only and is served to MyCrypto.com


#### If you would like to play around with this one for whatever reason:

First, clone the repo and `cd` into the working directory. Then...

```
$ npm install
```

```
$ npm run dev
```

Open the resulting `dist/index.html` file in your browser.

Gulp will auto-build it upon save.

#### To Prep for Production
```
$ gulp prep
```

```
$ gulp zipit
```
